# JavaFX-SoccerLeagueSimulation
 This repository contains a JavaFX version of a soccer league simulation program built using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. The program aims to simulate a Brazilian soccer league, allowing users to simulate matches, and generate league standings in interface. 

This project is an "upgrade" on a different one. You can check it on my profile! ðŸ˜‰
